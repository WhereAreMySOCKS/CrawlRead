# CrawlRead - Free English Reading Tool

A backend project designed to help npy develop the habit of reading English.

CrawlRead is based on the FastAPI framework and works seamlessly with the [React frontend](https://github.com/WhereAreMySOCKS/html-article-viewer) to periodically fetch English news articles and provide **translation, AI analysis, and question generation features**.

## ðŸ“° Article Crawling

Currently supports automatic fetching of multiple sections from the **Christian Science Monitor (CSM)** (see config.yaml):
- Business
- World
- USA
- Arts

*CSM is a serious and internationally-focused news outlet. Although founded by the Christian Science Church, its reporting is not religious propaganda but is known for being objective, in-depth, and analytical, earning the title "the conscience of journalism." The Christian Science Monitor is also an **important source for English reading comprehension questions in postgraduate entrance exams**.*
